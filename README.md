# Online Training Syllabus
*Daily Bruin Online, Winter 2017*

**Instructor:** Byron Lutz (<byronlutz@gmail.com>), Full-stack engineer at [Factual](https://factual.com).    
**Materials:** Bring your laptop and a charger to each training session. All software we use is free and mostly open-source.    
**Location:** Location may change each week. (Week 1: Ackerman 3508)    
**Time:** Trainings are from 10:30 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. We'll take a lunch break around noon each day, so either bring money or pack a lunch.    
**Attendance:** Attending all three trainings (and the media-law training) are all **mandatory**. You will be working in groups during the trainings, so it's difficult to plan unless everyone is present.

**Office Hours:** There won't be any official office hours, however feel free to email Byron any time. If you think other people may have the same question, please post an issue in this repo so everyone can see and respond!
