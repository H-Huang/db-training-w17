# Second project: Live Earthquake Data

**Task:** Build an interactive web page that displays live earthquake data from USGS.

**Requirements:**
* Use the [USGS Earthquake GeoJSON API](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) (choose any of the live feeds)
* Display the earthquake data on your page using Handlebars
* Style the page with a CSS file
* Add some other interactive feature of your choosing. *E.g. a live refresh function, a map, etc.*
* Track your code in Git

**Challenge:** Use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) instead of the USGS feed to make an interactive display of any user's repositories. Follow all other requirements.

**Due Saturday, October 22, 2016 @ 5:00pm**
* Send me a link to your team's code. (GitHub is preferred.)
* Individually, send me a brief status report, describing challenges you faced, things you learned, resources you used, and what you want to learn in the next training.
